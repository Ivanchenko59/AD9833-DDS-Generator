# AD9833-DDS-Generator

## Description

A simple signal generator based on the ***AD9833*** chip. 
The project is built on the ***STM32F401*** microcontroller
using a 1.8 inch TFT display based on the ***ST7735*** driver, 
and an ***EC11*** rotary encoder is also used for control.

## About the project
The purpose of this project is to create a small ***educational 
project*** based on the STM32 microcontroller using the HAL library. 
And also, ***writing a library of the AD9833 chip for experience*** 
with technical documentation. I also tried to document my first library. 

In the near future, I will publish the library in a separate repository.

## Demo Video
Here you can watch a video of the demo version.

## Future Release 
* Sweep mode
* Change signal amplitude
* PCB design
* Development of a case for the device
* Create documentation
* Full github project with a demo of work an oscilloscope
